Final credit:
For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, so that whoever believes in Him will not perish but inherit eternal life.

And last but not least, final credit goes to God our Father, for sending His Son to die on the cross, setting us free from sin. We bring this software to you for free because He has set us free.
